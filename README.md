# Mini-Project-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Underwater mines or naval mines are self-contained explosive devices placed in water

to destroy enemiesâ€™ surface ships or submarines. Underwater mines are used since the mid-
19th Century. Sea mines were introduced by David Bushner in 1977 during the American

civil war. Previously mines were only activated by physical contact but the newly created
mines can be activated by various methods. Modern mines can be activated by acoustic,
pressure, and magnetic changes in the water which provoke them to explode. These are called
influence mines.
Generally, underwater mines are classified as offensive or defensive warfare.
1) Offensive mines are strewn across hostile shipping lanes in order to damage
merchant ships and military boats.
2) Defensive mines are placed along coastlines to divert enemy submarines and ships
away from critical locations and into more heavily guarded places. Usually, Mines are
mistaken as rocks during their identification, as mines can have the same shape, length, and
width as rocks.
